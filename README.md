## **About Auditory**

NOTE: Development of Auditory is currently on hold, and will return in a complete rewrite of the mod eventually! There is no estimated time of release for the rewrite as of now, but it should be sometime around 2024!

Auditory is a Minecraft mod for [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net) 1.19 that reworks and enhances a lot of the sound aspects in Minecraft, from block sounds to item interaction sounds and more! For more information for developers on how you can modify any existing sound groups or add compatibility for your mods or datapacks, check out the [Developer Wiki](https://github.com/Sydokiddo/auditory/wiki/Developer-Guide)!
